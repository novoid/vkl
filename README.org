* vkl - a better "ls"-experience

This Python script is a wrapper for the GNU/Linux ~ls~-tool for simple
cases. To be precise, it's a substitute (only) for the following command:

: ls -lt --all --reverse --directory --classify --color=auto

In contrast to the standard ~ls~ output, this script visualizes time
in a much better way:

[[file:images/vkl-Screenshot.png]]

Normal ~ls~ command is listing all files without proper way to
visualize brand-new, new, old, and very old files. By introducing
horizontal bars that sub-divide the output in a pseudo-logarithmical
way, the user gets a *much better feeling on the age* of the items in
the current directory.

- *Target group*: users of a GNU/UNIX command line or similar
- Hosted on github: https://github.com/novoid/guess-filename.py

By the way: yes, I tried to get this functionality to the GNU project
to be included to ~ls~. I failed miserably. To me, they don't seem to
add such features for many years. Very conservative :-(

** Usage

#+BEGIN_SRC sh :results output :wrap src
vkl --help
#+END_SRC

#+BEGIN_src
Usage:
         vkl <options>

This tool lists the current directory content in various metric
GNU ls does not provide.

Options:
  -h, --help         show this help message and exit
  -l, --log          displays directory content by a pseudo logarithmic time
                     (default option)
  -m, --mtime        sort items using modification time (default option)
  -c, --ctime        sort items using change time
  -a, --atime        sort items using access time
  -p, --primitivels  use primitive output of directory rather than using GNU
                     ls
  --debug            enable (senseless) debug output
#+END_src


Examples:

: vkl
... the simplest case, sorted by modification time

: vkl -c
... sorted by change time

: vkl -p
... using its own (primitive, self-written) output to circumvent output issues or to use it on non-GNU/UNIX system
